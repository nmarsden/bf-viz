Short Description: bf-viz is a brainfuck interpreter and visualizer built with Three.js 

Ideas:
- user can select a sample bf programs to run
- user can type in their own bf program to run
- the program being run is shown on a HUD with the current instruction highlighted
- the memory is visualized as a list of numbers
- the memory pointer is visualized as an arrow pointing to a number in memory
- the output is shown as text somewhere in the 3D environment
- possibly also show the output on the HUD
- each instruction when run will effect the environment
-- '+'
-- '-'
-- '>'
-- '<'
-- '['
-- ']'
-- '.'
-- ','
- also need to think about input. possibly a string input buffer can be specified when entering the program


More ambitious idea of 'Game mode':
- have a 'Game mode' where the player can interact with the 3D environment 
- the user is set a goal to write a bf program, eg. a bf program which outputs 'HELLO WORLD' 
- instead of typing in the code the user must interact with the environment
- difficulty is increased by game mechanics such as:-
   1) Output mechanic - to output a letter the user must shoot a number at a moving target
